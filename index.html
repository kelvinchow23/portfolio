							<h5>STANDARD CELL CULTURE</h5>
							<p>The human body is dynamic, complex, and extremely challenging to study. A lot of what we know about how the human body functions is through studying biology on a cell level.  Interpolating from cell function to human body function is a huge jump, which avoids the importance of tissue and organ-level functions.  Studying cells in a petri dish is not an accurate model for the human body. Neither is animal testing, which has poor success translating to human clinical relevance.</p>
						<img src="./img/organ on a chip/intro old.png" class="img-fluid"></img>
						</div>
						
						<div class="col-6">
							<h5>NEWER DEVELOPMENTS</h5>
							<p>The purpose of organ-on-a-chip technology is to provide a better in-vitro model to study cells by recapturing relevant tissue and organ level functions.  These custom engineered models introduce physiological-relevant dynamics.  For example when the heart beats, it causes cells to undergo shear stresses from pulsatile blood flow and membrane straining from tissue contractions.  By introduced dynamics, the goal is to define a new standard for disease and drug response modeling.</p>

					<h2>Developing a Tube Hosting Device</h2>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-7" style="border-right: 2px solid #ccc">
								<p>These tubes are challenging to physically manipulate (we use the analogy of handling wet toilet paper) and we needed to come up with a hosting device to perform cell culture experiments.  We developed a device with 4 access ports to the luminal (interior) and abluminal (exterior) space of a 2cm long collagen tube segment.  The device was made using clear acrylic for imaging access.  All components were autoclavable.

								<p>With such a small internal volume inside the tube, there was not enough cell culture media to sustain long term cell culture inside our tubes.  To overcome this problem, we came up with a rocking platform to recirculate media from reservoirs attached to the ports of our device. To run multiple experiments at a time, we developed this seesaw to hold 36 chips inside an incubator, allowing for intermittent gravity-driven perfusion.

					<h2>Utility for Barrier Tissue Studies</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-5">
							<p>In human physiology, barrier tissues are a permeable membrane that regulate transport of gases, nutrients, drugs, and others. 
							</p>
							<p>
							One method for studying tissue barriers is culturing cells on Transwell inserts in a well plate.  This is a  porous plastic insert used to create two compartments inside a well plate.  A common experiment to check for barrier integrity is a trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurement.  Two probes are inserted on both sides of the insert and the electrical resistance across the membrane is measured.

							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-9">
									<p>In our custom tube hosting device, we could not use commercial TEER equipment, which could only be done in traditional well plates.  Thus, we needed to adapt the TEER principle and develop our own system to monitor barrier tissue function in our devices.
								</p>
								<p>On the right, we developed our own electrode probes that insert into the reservoirs of our device.  We supply a voltage from a function generator and measure the voltage drop across the tube membrane to measure TEER across our tubular membrane.

As the cells proliferated to create a complete barrier, we see a gradual increase in the membrane resistance.  At day 11, we start to see a plateau, indicating complete cell coverage inside our tube.  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202001746" style="color:white" target="_blank"><u>We later demonstrated the utility of this TEER setup to study barrier function, where we exposed our tubular tissues barriers to various drugs and stimulants</u></a>.

				<h3 class="mb-3">Microfluidics for molecular gastronomy</h3>
				</div>
				<p>Microfluidics is the manipulation of fluids at small volumes in devices with microscale channel dimensions. This field of study has become increasingly popular, especially for biology. Microfluidic devices are bio-compatible and the small volumes are advantageous since many biological samples are expensive and often difficult to extract at large quantities. Bio-printing is the technology intertwining 3D printing and biology showing promising potential in personalized healthcare. Bio-printers range in capabilities, with some focusing on printing with biocompatible materials while others engineer tissue by printing bio-inks containing living cells.</p>
				<p>At the Guenther lab at the University of Toronto, one research focus is to develop microfluidic bio-printing technologies. As most of my work is currently in progress and unpublished, it will not be disclosed in this portfolio. Instead, I will highlight smaller projects using microfluidics for molecular gastronomy.</p>

				</div>
					<p>Molecular gastronomy is where food meets science to flip traditional culinary practices.  With the same ingredients, the perception of taste can be altered through molecular gastronomy.  Here, we focus on using microfluidics to generate micro-scale edibles. The preparation of 3 different dishes will be shown. (Please be prepared to exercise some level of imagination... Thanks.)</p>
					<p>For each dish, a different microfluidic device is used. All 3 devices are flow-focusing devices to create alginate gels, dependent on the reaction between sodium alginate and calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>). The two solutions create an ionic reaction, producing an edible, tasteless calcium alginate gel. All devices contain a junction where alginate-filled channel is sandwiched in between two other channels.  By controlling the flowrate ratios, the dimensions of the gels can be tuned.

				<h2>Gesture Control Remote 1: Hardware Development</h2>
				<h3 class="mb-2">An inclusive gesture control device for individuals with cerebral palsy </h3>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-8">
						<br>
						<p><b>THE PROBLEM:</b>  For most people, interacting with digital devices is easy and second nature.  Input devices such as a phone touchscreen, a computer mouse/keyboard, or a TV remote are require little thought or concentration to use.  However, these devices are not designed for everyone.  People with impaired motor control or impaired vision, have a very difficult time using these devices, which require fine motor control.  Commercial assistive technology are often expensive, limited in options, and are not generally designed with these user in mind. Everyone is unique in how they move, making it challenging to design a user-friendly, all-encompassing solution.</p>
						<p><b>THE GOAL:</b>  To design low-cost, inclusive assistive technology for individuals with cerebral palsy to help them interact with digital devices easily.</p>						
						<p><b>THE DREAM:</b>  To close the digital accessibility gap between the general population and the cerebral palsy population.  With this device, we want to give individuals with cerebral palsy (and other disabilities, too) greater individuality and be more capable of making positive contributions to society.</p>
						<p>This project was a 2 month sprint in collaboration with Hackaday and the non-profit organization, United Cerebral Palsy Los Angeles.

						<p>One thing we learned about the UCPLA community is the emphasis on visual arts.  The UCPLA art studio allows users to paint with different body extremities (head, arm, leg, etc.) with the help of 3D-printed adaptive painting tools (see right images).</p>
						<p>Inspired by watching UCPLA artists paint, my thought was: could we capture these motions and apply it to use digital graphics software?  Using 2 <a href="https://m5stack.com/products/stick-c" style="color:white" target="_blank"><u>M5StickC microcontrollers</u></a> as "floating joysticks", I used these "joysticks" to replace a computer mouse for drawing images in Microsoft Paint.

				<p>If I can use this device, then it's kind of cool.  If an individual with cerebral palsy can use this device, then it becomes useful.  Step 1 was to find a simple application suitable for testing. For this, I chose a computer maze game requiring 4 directional inputs (keyboard arrow keys).  This application should be familiar for users who operate motorized wheelchairs with the ubiquitos 4-direction joystick.  The left video shows me playing this game with two extremities, demonstrating robustness of this device.  The right animation is from the first remote user testing session within a UCPLA residence, where our first user was able to successfully use this device, too.  It was amazing to see how engaged the user was and also provided <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/173454-2020-hdp-dream-team-ucpla/log/182616-first-user-testing-session-with-ucpla" style="color:white" target="_blank"><u>valuable learning lessons</u></a> for future device iterations.</p>

				<h3 class="mb-2">USING TINYML TO MAKE GESTURE CONTROL TRULY ADAPTIVE</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-8">
					<p><b>Limitations of Initial Prototype:</b> During the initial hardware development phase of the gesture control project, it was clear during the user testing sessions that the initial signal processing of the IMU data was not adaptive enough to meet the needs of each unique user in the cerebral palsy community.  Seeing our device used by others showed us that we were still forcing gestures that seemed unnatural. There was also a limitation that with our initial approach, we would not be able to scale the number of output gestures, which would have been limited to about 10 gestures. 
					</p>
					<p> <b>New Approach: </b> There was a thought that implementing a machine learning model would have been complementary for our application. After skimming the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/tinyml/9781492052036/" style="color:black" target="_blank"><u>TinyML textbook</u></a>, we thought integrating this was feasible.  We saw that TinyML could be the enabling technology that allowed for a high degree of user configuration, perfect for a community were user's abilities and needs are one-of-one.

				<h2>Reconfigurable Display </h2>
				<h3 class="mb-2">An electronic display with the ability to change size and aspect ratio</h3>
				</div>
					<p>Moore's law drives technological advancement to make electronics smaller. However, the cellphone, the most prevalent electronic device, defies this trend.  Why is this?  Once touchscreens became practical, it created a trade-off between convenience and practicality.  It is more convenient to carry around a smaller phone, but large electronic displays offer more utility. Arguably, the main difference between a cellphone, a tablet, and a laptop is the size of the electronic display. Electronics with reconfigurable displays would maximize the convenience and utility benefits of these devices.</p>
					<p>The common approach in the flexible display research area is to use semiconductor fabrication with the key difference being swapping the silicon substrate for flexible, stretchable substrates (see figure below).  The key issue with this approach is once the substrate is stretched, the pixel density decreases, reducing the image quality. Also, this approach is dependent on the substrate's mechanical properties, which diminish when stretched.  This project proposes a different approach to this problem. </p>

					<p>The first design proposed a solution where 16 individual square "islands", each representing an LED, would move uniformly.  Each island was constrained to move linearly on a track and connected to other islands via guide arms.  By moving one island, all islands would move simultaneously.</p>
					<p> Two major problems of this design forced a redesign.  First, this design required extra space to function, defeating the purpose of having a compact design.  Second, this design shared the same flaw as the flexible substrate approach, which did not conserve pixel density when stretched. </p>

				<h2>Balance Rehabilitation Game </h2>

				<p>Individuals suffering from spinal cord injuries (SCI) often have balance instability caused by a reduced neural control of lower-limbed muscles.  Rehabilitation tools have been demonstrated to be effective in repairing the disconnect between brain and body.  Two rehabilitation tools of interest are visual feedback training (VFT) and functional electrical stimulation (FES) therapy.  </p>

				<h2>Vehicular Rear-View Camera System </h2>
				<h3 class="mb-4">A camera-based module to replace the wing mirror</h3>
				</div>
				<p>Vehicles come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and utilities - from sports cars to common sedans, hybrids to vintage cars, or trucks to Smart cars. While the rest of the vehicle has morphed to fit modern times, the wing mirror design has stagnated and looks comparable between most vehicles (see vehicles below).</p>  
				<p>The wing mirror design has been a major design flaw for over a century and requires a drastic design change. First, the wing mirror is a safety hazard.  It creates blindspot zones, making it standard procedure for drivers to keep their head on a 180° swivel for blindspot checks before changing lanes. This flaw has existed for over a century and has never been fully addressed.  At fast speeds, fractions of a a second can be the difference between life or death. The safest option is for drivers to always keep their eyes on the road in front of them.  Second, the wing mirror is the only part of the vehicle that unexpectedly extrudes out from the body of the car.  Although relatively small, this obtrusion can cause up to 7% of total vehicle drag during driving.  </p>
				<p class="mb-5">Automakers are pushing to eliminate the law requiring vehicles to have anachronistic wing mirrors. We (hopefully) preview the future of wing mirror-less vehicles.</p>

					<p class="col-5">Due to the scope of the project, the system was designed around an off-the-shelf Raspberry Pi camera board, serving as the geometric constraint for our module. To not further increase the footprint of our module, a custom PCB was fabricated and placed over the camera board.  The PCB includes high power infrared (IR) LEDs for night time viewing, heater connections for de-icing, a temperature sensor, and an ambient light sensor.</p>

The housing prototype is 3D printed and provides a water-tight seal from the outdoor environment. A dual bandpass filter is placed in front of the camera lens to allow transmission of visible light and a narrow range on the same wavelength as our IR LEDs.</p>

It is clear from these videos that the IR LED improves visibility at night.  When the car enters the section without streetlights (or any other external light), the IR LED allows the camera to pick up the lane markings on the road.  In comparison, the side mirror would have shown a pitch black view, demonstrating a driver's current dependency of external light. This camera module allows the driver to see potential vehicles with their headlights off (or moose, bears, zebras, kangaroos, or camels) that sneak up on us.</p>

					<p> Due to the limitations of time and money, the project was narrowed down to a manageable scope, demonstrating a few key concepts. Ideally, we would have put an emphasis on seamlessly integrating the monitors into the vehicle's dashboard to improve driving experience. With more time, another point of emphasis would have been coupling the camera system with haptic feedback in the steering wheel so drivers can feel their surroundings. There are numerous other ways in which technology can be used to improve our driving experience, so why not use it?</p>

						<p> Here is the bed in action. Instead of the traditional approach of waking up through sound, this bed uses the sense of (an excessively aggressive) touch.  This alarm clock comes with a 100% guarantee of waking someone up.  Although promising in its effectiveness, further persistence of getting this product to market would be met with too many lawsuits.  BTW, if this gif had sound, you would have heard a gunshot. RIP Blue Clock (2015-2015).
