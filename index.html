				<h2>Reconfigurable Display </h2>
				<h3 class="mb-2">An electronic display with the ability to change size and aspect ratio</h3>
				</div>
					<p>Moore's law drives technological advancement to make electronics smaller. However, the cellphone, the most prevalent electronic device, defies this trend.  Why is this?  Once touchscreens became practical, it created a trade-off between convenience and practicality.  It is more convenient to carry around a smaller phone, but large electronic displays offer more utility. Arguably, the difference between a cellphone, a laptop, and a tablet is the size of the electronic display. Electronics with reconfigurable displays would maximize the convenience and utility benefit of these electronic devices.</p>
					<p>The general approach in this research field is to place rigid LEDs on soft flexible, stretchable substrates (see figure below).  The key issue with this approach is once the substrate is stretched, the pixel density decreases, reducing the image quality. Also, this approach is dependent on the substrate's mechanical properties, which diminish when stretched.  This project proposes a different approach to this problem. </p>

				<h2 class="mx-auto mb-3">The Initial Design </h2>
				</div>
					<p>The first design proposed a solution where 16 individual square "islands", each representing an LED, would move uniformly.  Each island was constrained to move linearly on a track and connected to other islands via guide arms.  By moving one island, all islands would move simultaneously.</p>
					<p> Two major problems of this design forced a redesign.  First, this design required extra space to function, defeating the purpose of having a compact design.  Second, this design shared the same flaw as the flexible substrate approach, which did not conserve pixel density when stretched. </p>

				<h2>Balance Rehabilitation Game </h2>
				<h3 class="mb-2">An independent, novel balance rehabilitation trainer</h3>

				<p>Individuals suffering from spinal cord injuries (SCI) often have balance instability caused by a reduced neural control of lower-limbed muscles.  Rehabilitation tools have been demonstrated to be effective in repairing the disconnect between brain and body.  Two rehabilitation tools of interest are visual feedback training (VFT) and functional electrical stimulation (FES) therapy.  </p>

						<h4>Static Balance Assessment</h4>
						<p>An individual was asked to stand on the force plate with their eyes closed as still as possible for 100 seconds. During this time, a centre of position (COP) time series would record and track the involuntary sway of the individual.  For these studies, three performance indicators were taken: root means squared (RMS) in the (1) anterior-posterior (front to back) and (2) medial-lateral (side to side) direction, and (3) 95% confidence ellipse of the data.</p>

						<p>An individual was prompted by our GUI to perform the "star reaching task", where the individual leaned as far as possible without losing balance in the prompted direction.

					<h4 class="mb-2">Future Direction</h4>
					<p>One problem was for some games (ellipse and colour matching), everyone had high scores. This made it difficult to distinguish an individual's balance ability with game scores. Immediately after the trial run, this problem was addressed by changing the scoring system to favour individuals who could keep their balance position closer to the centre of the game targets.</p> 
					<p>The next step would be to conduct another trial run on able-bodied participants, this time incorporating functional electrical stimulation.  Once completed and further system optimizations are performed, the system would be ready for use in clinical trials on individuals with spinal cord injuries to determine the effectiveness of this rehabilitation tool.</p>

				<p>Microfluidics is the manipulation of fluids at small volumes in devices with microscale channel dimensions. This field of study has become increasingly popular, especially for biology. Microfluidic devices are bio-compatible and the small volumes are advantageous since many biological samples are expensive and often difficult to extract at large quantities. Bio-printing is the technology intertwining 3D printing and biology showing promising potential in personalized healthcare. Bio-printers range in capabilities, with some focusing on printing with biocompatible materials while others engineer tissue by printing bio-inks containing living cells.</p>
				<p>At the Guenther lab at the University of Toronto, one research focus is to develop microfluidic bio-printing technologies. As most of my work is currently in progress and unpublished, it will not be disclosed in this portfolio. Instead, I will highlight smaller projects using microfluidics for molecular gastronomy.</p>

				</div>
					<p>Molecular gastronomy is where food meets science to flip traditional culinary practices.  With the same ingredients, the perception of taste can be altered through molecular gastronomy.  Here, we focus on using microfluidics to generate micro-scale edibles. The preparation of 3 different dishes will be shown. (Please be prepared to exercise some level of imagination. Thanks.)</p>
					<p>For each dish, a different microfluidic device is used. All 3 devices are flow-focusing devices to create alginate gels, dependent on the reaction between sodium alginate and calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>). The two solutions create an ionic reaction, producing an edible, tasteless calcium alginate gel. All devices contain a junction where alginate-filled channel is sandwiched in between two other channels.  By controlling the flowrate ratios, the dimensions of the gels can be tuned.

				<h2>Vehicular Rear-View Camera System </h2>
				<h3 class="mb-4">A camera-based module to replace the wing mirror</h3>
				</div>
				<p>Vehicles come in all sorts of shapes and sizes from sports cars to common sedans, from hybrids to vintage cars, or from trucks to Smart cars. While the rest of the vehicle has morphed to fit modern times, the wing mirror design has stagnated and looks comparable between most vehicles (see vehicles below).</p>  
				<p>The wing mirror design has been a major design flaw for over a century and requires a drastic design change. First, the wing mirror is a safety hazard.  It creates blindspot zones, making it standard procedure for drivers to keep their head on a 180° swivel for blindspot checks before changing lanes. This flaw has existed for over a century and has never been fully addressed.  At fast speeds, fractions of a a second can be the difference between life or death. The safest option is for drivers to always keep their eyes on the road in front of them.  Second, the wing mirror is the only part of the vehicle that unexpectedly extrudes out from the body of the car.  Although relatively small, this obtrusion can cause up to 7% of total vehicle drag during driving.  </p>
				<p class="mb-5">Automakers are pushing to eliminate the law requiring vehicles to have anachronistic wing mirrors. We (hopefully) preview the future of wing mirror-less vehicles.</p>

					<p class="col-5">Due to the scope of the project, the system was designed around an off-the-shelf Raspberry Pi camera board, serving as the geometric constraint for our module. To not further increase the size of our system, a custom PCB was fabricated and placed over the camera board.  The PCB includes high power infrared (IR) LEDs for night time viewing, heater connections for de-icing, a temperature sensor, and an ambient light sensor.</p>

The housing prototype is 3D printed and provides a water-tight seal from the outdoor environment. A dual bandpass filter is placed in front of the camera lens to allow transmission of visible light and a narrow range on the same wavelength as our IR LEDs.</p>

Yet, in our camera view, the passing car is still in frame and only leaves the frame when the car has fully our vehicle.  Thus, our camera eliminates the blindspot of cars in the adjacent lane.</p>

The left is our camera with the infrared LED turned on, and the right is the camera with the light off.  The right view is similar to the view of the side mirror.  It is clear from these videos that the IR LED improves visibility at night.  When the car enters the section without streetlights (or any other external light), the IR LED allows the camera to pick up the lane markings on the road.  In comparison, the side mirror would have shown a pitch black view, demonstrating how dependent drivers currently are on external sources of light. This camera module allows the driver see potential vehicles with their headlights off (or moose, bears, zebras, kangaroos, or camels) that sneak up on us.</p>

With the monitor placed in front of the driver, we demonstrated a driving experience without having to tilt your head to check blindspots.</p>
					<p> Due to the limitations of time and money, the project was narrowed down to a manageable scope, demonstrating a few key concepts. Ideally, we would have put an emphasis on seamlessly integrating the monitors into the vehicle's dashboard to improve driving experience. With more time, another point of emphasis would have been coupling the camera system with haptic feedback in the steering wheel so drivers can feel their surroundings. There are numerous other ways in which technology can be used to improve our driving experience, so why not use it?</p>
